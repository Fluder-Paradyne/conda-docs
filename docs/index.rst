*Package, dependency and environment management for any
language---Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++,
Fortran, and more.*

Conda is an open source package management system and environment
management system that runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and z/OS. Conda
quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies.
Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments
on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it
can package and distribute software for any language.

But conda is also an ecosystem with many components, serving different
use cases and user groups. To learn more, please choose one of the
