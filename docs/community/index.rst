and `conda
<https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/#!forum/conda>`_.

Contribute recipes to GitHub
===============================

Submit new recipes to the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes or https://github.com/conda-forge.
When you build a new conda recipe for a program not yet listed in the
repository, use a GitHub pull request to submit it to the repository,
so that others using that program in the future can reuse it.

Report bugs
==============

If you find a bug, search to see if it has already been reported,
and then report it if no one else has.

Issues with the conda documentation are tracked on GitHub at
https://github.com/conda/conda-docs/issues.

For issues with conda, conda-build, repo.anaconda.com, anaconda.org,
and specific conda packages, please see :ref:`new-issues`.
